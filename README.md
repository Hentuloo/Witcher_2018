# Witcher_2018
My old witcher 'project'


## What i would do beter today:(i did this project in 2018)
- navigation should be in ul>li and with some hidden titles
- images should be dynamic for different screens
- preloader should have some animations
- active button should be more unique
- ES6
- styles, javascript and images in different files/folders
